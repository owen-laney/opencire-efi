## Opencore EFI
The opencore EFI I use to run macOS Ventura on my personal machine. You can use this as an example or try to replicate it, but *always* build your efi from scratch. The [dortania](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) guide has great instructions, and it covers almost every system out there. If something isn't covered in the guide use google, DON'T INSTALL THE FILES IN THIS REPO.
